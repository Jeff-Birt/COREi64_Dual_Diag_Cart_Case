# COREi64_Dual_Diag_Cart_Case
3D printable case for the COREi64 Dual Diag Cart

Based on OpenCart64 design from https://github.com/svenpetersen1965/C64-Diagnostic-Rev.-586220-Harness

The 'Corner Helpers' are 3/4 circles that can be placed so that the open section is hugging the corners of a square part. This provides more thermal mass and adhesion for the corners or parts to keep them from wanting to lift during printing.
