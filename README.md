# COREi64_Dual_Diag_Cart_Case
3D printable case for the COREi64 Dual Diag Cart

Based on OpenCart64 design from https://github.com/svenpetersen1965/C64-Diagnostic-Rev.-586220-Harness

The 'Corner Helpers' are 3/4 circles that can be placed so that the open section is hugging the corners of a square part. This provides more thermal mass and adhesion for the corners or parts to keep them from wanting to lift during printing.

The following files are modifed version of Sven Petersen's diagnostic harness case files. The two front screw posts were moved back to allow for screw holes to connect the edge connector to the case with M3 or 4-40 screws. This takes the stress off of the solder connections.

EDIT: These files are provided freely. It is always polite to credit the source if you modify them and make them available or if are using freely provided files for a product you are selling.
